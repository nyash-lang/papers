Curated papers about the Nyash programming language.

  - Draft (JP): https://github.com/moe-charm/nyash/blob/main/docs/papers/active/paper-a-mir13-ir-design/main-paper-jp.md
  - Repro artifacts: same repo under `docs/papers/active/paper-a-mir13-ir-design/_artifacts/`

- **Paper B: Nyash language & execution model**

## Plan

- Host camera-ready PDFs here once ready (arXiv link + DOI if any).
